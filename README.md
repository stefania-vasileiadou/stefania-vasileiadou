# Hi there 👋

I'm Stefania (pronounced <em>Steh-fah-NEE-a</em>), and I'm working towards a career in Software Development. Currently, I am a Junior at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/), pursuing a dual degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

## 🧩 Quick Facts 
- I'm originally from Athens, Greece, and I have heritage from the island on which the Odyssey is based
- I'm fluent in Greek and English and proficient in French
- I'm pretty entrepreneurial and even started my own biodegradable makeup startup in High School
- I love hiking and spending time surrounded by nature
- I really enjoy gastronomy and exploring the Chicago restaurant scene
- I have a weirdly strong interest in credit cards

## 👩🏻‍💻 Past Experience
**Software Engineer Intern @ Qualco**  
Part of the <em>Strategic Projects Team</em>, developed an MCP server for [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) and integrated 40+ tools through a CLI chatbot using the Groq API.
