# Hi there 👋

I'm Stefania (pronounced <em>Steh-fah-NEE-a</em> [^1]), and I'm working towards a career in Software Development. Currently, I am a Junior at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/), pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.  

I'm very interested in low-level programming and even TA for the relevant [intro-level course](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/213-20.html) at Northwestern. Generally, I like building fast, performant systems that take advantage of of modern hardware.

You can reach me via email at stefania[at]u.northwestern.edu
